Git Guide

1. git init
- Initialize a hidden folder where all info and branch is in.

2. git add
- Staging a change, therefore adding a file in so that it is ready to commit.
* "git ." - Add all file for staging

3. git status
- Telling if a file is tracked or untracked.
- If a file is modified, then when using git status again, the file is not yet staged.

4. git commit
- Going to a VIM-like interface where you can commit changes.
* I - Insert: Write a text, escape to go back to command.
* :wq - Commit the changes with the comment.

5. git commit <arg> '<comment>'
* -m: Commit straight without using the VIM interface.
* -a: Skip staging, any files that is tracked will commit, and vice versa.

6. .gitignore file
- Used to exclude any file name.extension that you don't want to use
EX: *.log

7. git branch <name>
- Create a branch separate from master branch

8. git checkout <branchname>
- Going back to another branch specified
- Save any changes you made in that branch

8.a. git stash
> Use after git add <file>
- Store the file away until you want to come back and commit the change

8.b. git stash apply
- Apply the changes you stashed earlier

9. git merge <branchname>
