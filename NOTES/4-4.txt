CSC 2100: Chapter 11

Nested Structure
- A structure can contain another structure as member
> struct PersonInfo
> {	string name, 
>		   address, 
>		   city;
> }
> struct Student
> {	int studentID;
>			PersonInfo pData;
> }

- Use the dot operator to refer to refer to fields of nested structure
> Student s;
> s.pData.name = "Some";
> s.pData.city = "body";

Structures as function arguments
- May pass members of struct variables to functions:
> computeGPA(stu.gpa);
- May pass entire struct variables to funct:
> showData(stu);
- Can use reference parameter if function needs to modify content of structure variable

Returning a Structure from a Function
- Function can return a struct:
> Student getStudentData();		// Prototype
> stu1 = getStudentData();		// call
