Combining data into structure
- structure: C++ construct that allows multiple variables to be grouped together
> struct <structname>	// structure tag
> {
>   type1 field1;	// structure member 
>   type2 field2;	// structure member
> }
- Type = datatype, field = variable name
EX in CLASS 25
- Structure name would always have an uppercase letter
EX: struct Student {}
- Multiple variable could be held in one data type

Defining variables (structure declaration)
- To define variables, use structure tag as type name:
> Student bill;

Accessing Structure Members
- Use the dot (.) operator to refer to members of struct variable
> cin >> stul.studentID;
> getline (cin, stu1.name);
> stu1.gpa = 1;

Displaying struct variable
> cout << bill;		// Does not work
> cout << bill.studentID;

Same with Comparison, need the dot operator.

Initializing Structure
- struct variable can be initialized when defined
> Student s = {11465, "Joan", 2, 3.75};
- Can also initialize member-by-member
> s.name = "Joan";

Arrays of Structures
- Can be used in place of parallel arrays
> Student stuList[CONST];
- Individual accessible using subscript notation
- Field within structures accessible using dot notation
> cout << stuList[5].studentID;
