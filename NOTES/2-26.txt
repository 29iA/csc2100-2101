CSC 2100: Chapter 6

Sending Data into a Function
- Can pass values into a function at time of call
- Values passed to function are arguments
- Variables in function that hold value passed as arguments are parameter
EX:
> void displayValue(int num) {
>	cout << num;
>}
Integer parameter = num
Data type parameter = int
Argument = specific num inputted (1,2,5,8)

- When a function parameter is passed, it can't be used in the main function since it's only in that function.

Passing Multiple Arguments
- When passing multiple arguments
  - Number of argument much match data type and definition
EX: 
> void function(int, bool, float);
> int val1, val2, val3;
> function(val1, val2, val3);
- The order of the value entered is importance, as it sends directly how you sent it (left to right)
- Naming of the value does not matter unless its spot is not right.

Pass by value - when arg. passed to function, its value is copied into parameter, not the variable itself.

Return Statement - end execution of a function
- Can be placed anywhere in function, and statements after return statement won't be executed.
- void function without return statement, the function ends at its last }

Returning value from function
- In value-returning funcction, return statement can be used to return value from function to point of call.
EX:
> int sum (int num1, int num2) {
> 	double result;
>	result = num1+num2;
>	return result;
> }
- OR just do return (num1+num2) for the same effect as the original example.
