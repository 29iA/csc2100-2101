Loop - control structure that cause statements to repeat
While Loop
EX: while (expression) {statement;}
- Iteration - loop for (times)
- While loop is a pretest loop, where expression is evaluated before statement is execute.

While loop with Input Validation
- While loop can be used to reject invalid data and route back to loop.
EX:
> cin >> number;
> while (number >=10 ) {
> 	cout << "Invalid entry!";
> 	cin >> number;
> }

Counter - variable that is incremented or decremented each time loop repeats
 - Can be used to control execution of loop
 - Must be initialized

do-while loop - posttest loop; execute loop, then test the expression.
EX:
> do
> 	statement;
> while (expression);

for loop - pretest counter-controlled loop where we know how many time the counter iterates
EX:
> for (initialization; test expression; update)
> 	statement;
1) Perform initialization (count = 1)
2) Test expression (count <=5)
3) Do statement
4) Update (count++)
5) Test expression again
and Repeat 2 - 4 until test expression is false
