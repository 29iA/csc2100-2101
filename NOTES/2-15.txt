CSC 2100: Chapter 4-5

Blocks and Scope
- Scope of a variable is the block in which it is defined from the point of definition to the end of the block.
  - Defined at beginning of function except for some cases.
  - Can define function later if it's not used anywhere before it is defined.
  - Can define same variable if it's in a different block.
  - WARNING: CONFUSING AF
EX: 
int main () {
	variable				// Original var
	if () {variable}		// Original var is now overshadowed in this block
	variable				// After block exit, then Original var is returned

Increment & Decrement Operators
- ++ (increment operator) adds 1 to variable
EX: val++; == val = val + 1;
- Can be used before (prefix) or after (postfix) a variable: ++val;  ==  val++;
- Vice versa with -- (decrement operator) subtract 1 to variable, just replace ++ with -- and you got val - 1.

Prefix vs. Postfix
- In prefix mode (++val, --val) the operator do incre or decre, then returns value
- In postfix mode (val++, val--) operator returns value, then incre or decre
EX: 
> int val = 12;
> cout << val++;		// Display 12, +1, val == 13
> cout << ++val;		// +1, val == 14, display 14

Used in expression:
> result = num1++ + --num2;
- --num2 is first statement
- num1 + num2 second
- result assigned third
- num1 increment
