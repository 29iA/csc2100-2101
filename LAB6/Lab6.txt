1. Programming statement rewrite
	a. for loop
	
	int x;
	for (x = 1; x < 5; x++) {
		cout << "Two times " << x << " is " << (2 * x) << ".\n";
	}
	
	b. do-while loop
	
	int x = 1;
	do
	{
		cout << "Two times " << x << " is " << (2 * x) << ".\n";
		x++;
	} while (x < 5);
	
2. For loop is a 
	a. pre-test loop
3. While loop is 
	a. pre-test loop
4. Do-while loop is 
	b. post-test loop
5. A good use for the "do-while" loop is 
	a. To run program multiple times until user wants to quit.
6. Good use for the "for" loop is
	c. When you know the number of iterations of the loop (count-controlled loop)
7. Good use for the "for" loop is
	c. When you know the number of iterations of the loop (count-controlled loop)

8. Program will display
	a. 5
9. Program will display
	b. 6
10. Program will display
	a. It is true!
11. Program will display
	b. It is false!

12. Write a program segment that will ask the user for a number between 1 and 10. Using a while loop, validate that the user entered a valid number and force the user to enter a valid number if they did not.

	int x;
	cin >> x;
	while (x <= 0 || x > 10) {
		cout << "Invalid number, please enter a number between 1 and 10.\n";
		cin >> x;
	}
